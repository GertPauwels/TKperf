Visit https://github.com/thomas-krenn/TKperf to get current development
versions of TKperf and detailed changes.

Version 2.2 20180926
  * Add timestamps to log messages
  * Add read and write policies for megaraid devices
  * Use markdown for README
  * Set auto background initialization to off for megaraid devices
  * Fix device number to 2 if megaraid RAID10 devices are created
  * Add strip size for megaraid devices
  * NVME: use correct lbaf for nvme format command
  * Set correct StdyState if device did not reach steady state
  * NVME: use correct interface with NVME RAID devices

Version 2.1 20151016
  * Fix max rounds bug for SSD write saturation
    * If the maximum rounds 1440 was reached for an SSD the number of
      rounds has not been set correctly.
  * Add option for specifying test round runtime
  * Add 'fusion' to valid interface names, secure erasion FusionIO cards
  * Use nvme format for devices with nvme interface

Version 2.0 20150121
  * Refactor performance tests and devices with abstract classes
  * Devices implementing the Device class can be used as test device
  * Add a system package for interaction with OS command line tools like
    storcli or mdadm
  * Added new RAID tests, RAIDs are created automatically
    * Avago or LSI devices can be tested with a specific RAID config file
      * Preconditioning is done automatically on all devices in the RAID set
    * Software RAID with mdadm can be tested with a specific RAID config file
      * Preconditioning is done automatically on all devices in the RAID set
      * Secure erase is done automatically on all devices in the RAID set
  * SAS devices are tested automatically with sf_format and sg_info
  * Added new TKperf logo
  * Remove tkperf_dialog.sh as it is obsolete
  * Fix error in tkperf-comp LAT plot
  * Enhance tkperf-cmp
    * Plots can be put into a subfolder and be compressed with zip
  * If -g is used a PDF report is generated automatically
  * Reports can be sent to an email automatically, use -m and -s

Version 1.3 20140804
  * Support 3D plots also with matplotlib < 1.0
  * Added a sleep operation after each secure erase

Version 1.2 20131017
  * Return an error if hdparm doesn't work for HDD

Version 1.1 20130117
  * Checking for correct FIO version
  * Added more hdparm informations about a device (e.g. write-cache)
  * Description files to provide informations for devices that
    cannot be checked with hdparm
  * Loading from Xml is possible if plotting or reporting functions
    changed and the report should be generated again
  * With setup.py an installations script is provided to ease TKperf
    installation
  * FIO version is included in the report
  * Date of test run is included in the report
  * Number of jobs and number of outstanding I/Os can be changed
  * Added option "refill_buffers" to circumvent any compression of
    SSD controllers
  * OS distribution information is included in the report
  * tkperf_dialog.sh is a shell script to start a simple test script
    via answering interactive questions

      * Iops
      * Latency
      * Write Saturation
      * Throughput
    * Plots and measurement tables required by SNIA spec
    * Logging all FIO calls to log file
    * Xml file with test results
    * Rst file with restructured text
    * Rst file can be converted to pdf with rst2pdf
  * HDD
    * Tests
